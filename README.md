<h2 id="started">üöÄ Getting started</h2>

#### Configure yaml
First, configure your own jsdconfig.yaml file to select which data to load by default. There is a jsdconfig-example.yaml file provided that may be copied over or used as a template for your own config file.
* The filename needs to be specified, and a human-readable name should be provided for use in the plots and figures. 
* Please see the ***Generating custom excel files*** section for additional information.
* On your first run, you may use ```cp jsdconfig-example.yaml jsdconfig.yaml``` to load the MIDRC data.

#### Run application
To start the application, run `python main.py`

#### Generating plots and figures
* Select the files you wish to compare in the drop-down menus that you wish to make comparisons between. 
* A checkbox is provided next to the drop-down menus to select whether additional plots should be shown for each individual file selected. 
* Note: displaying plots for two or more files simultaneously may require a 4k monitor

#### Generating custom excel files
- Use the provided MIDRC, CDC, and Census Excel files as an example on how to prepare your custom data. 
- For each date, ***cumulative sums are expected***.
- **Each attribute should have its own sheet** which will be automatically parsed by the application.
- Column names within each sheet are parsed and compared between files
  - Where there is a matching column name within a worksheet of the same name, the JSD will be calculated using those values.
  - ***A Date column is expected***, and it should be sorted. Please see how the census data is loaded using the example config file if your data does not have multiple dates and you do not have a date column.
- The list of attributes provided in the GUI should be a list where worksheets with an identical name exist in both files. If it is not, please check your spelling
- The ```remove column name text``` config parameter is due to how the MIDRC data is generated. There is a ```(CUSUM)``` suffix that needs to be removed to compare it to CDC and Census data.

#### GUI Manipulation
The plots and figures should be movable, adjustable, re-sizable, or hidden. 

To see the list of available dock widgets, you can right-click on any menu/title bar area, i.e. either the main window menu bar or any title bar in a dock widget. This is useful if you hide one of hte docked widgets and wish to view them again.

Keyboard commands may be used to copy and paste the calculated JSD values (and dates) and pasted in Excel or a notebook as tab-delimited data.
